# Speedy Boilerplate - Home Page

The home page is the first page that the user sees when they visit the website. It contains the hero component, features, pricing, cta and the footer. The home page is located in the <Code>app/page.tsx</Code> file.

The home page is divided into multiple sections and each section is a component that is imported into the home page.

```tsx
import {
  Header,
  Hero,
  Stats,
  Features,
  Pricing,
  Faq,
  Cta,
  Footer,
} from "@/components";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main>
      <Header />
      <Hero />
      <Stats />
      <Features />
      <Pricing />
      <Faq />
      <Cta />
      <Footer />
    </main>
  );
}
```
