Google Auth is a popular authentication method, it allows users to sign in with their Google account to your application simply connecting their Google account to your application, this is a great way to increase the user experience and make it easier for users to sign in.

To setup authentication with Google + Supabase follow the steps below:

1: Go to the [Google Developers Console](https://console.cloud.google.com). If you don't have an account, you can create a new account and setup a new project.

2: Then go to the <Code>APIs & Services</Code> to setup the OAuth Consent Screen and OAuth Client ID.

3: Then go to the <Code>OAuth Consent Screen</Code> and fill in the required fields.

4: Once you've setup the OAuth Consent Screen, go to the <Code>Credentials</Code> click on <Code>Create Credentials</Code> and select <Code>OAuth client ID</Code>.

5: Then select the application type to <Code>Web Application</Code>.
<ul className="ml-8 list-disc">

    Add a name for the OAuth client ID.
  </li>
  <li>
    Click on the <Code>Add URI</Code> button on the <Code>Authorized JavaScript Origins</Code> and add the <Code>{`http://localhost:3000`}</Code> and your Supabase Project URL.
  </li>
  <li>
    Then go to the Supabase Dashboard -> Authentication -> Providers and click on the <Code>Google</Code>. There you will find the <Code>Callback URL (for OAuth)</Code> copy that URL and go back to the Google Developer Console and paste it to the <Code>Authorized Redirect URIs</Code> in the Google Developers Console.
  </li>
  <li>
    Then click on the **Create** button.
  </li>
</ul>

6: Then go to back to the Supabase Dashboard -> Authentication -> Providers and click on the **Google**, enable it and Copy/Paste the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the Google Developers Console to the Supabase Google Auth and save it.

## Magic Link
</DocsTitle>

Magic Link is a great way to authenticate users without the need of a password, it allows users to sign in with their email address and receive a magic link on their inbox to sign in to your application effortlessly. This is a great way to increase the user experience and make it easier for users to sign in.

To setup authentication with Magic Link you need to have a Supabase account that is already setup and a Resend account, in this part we will guide you on how to create a Resend account and integrate it with Supabase for sending Magic Link Authentication.

1: Go to the [Resend Sign Up](https://resend.com/signup) page and create a new account. You can use Email and Password, Google or GitHub to sign up.

2: Once your account is created, sign in and go to the Resend Dashboard to integrate it with Supabase. For integrating Resend with Supabase you can follow the [Resend + Supabase](https://resend.com/blog/how-to-configure-supabase-to-send-emails-from-your-domain) guide writted by Resend team. The guide also contains a video tutorial on how to setup Resend with Supabase which is very helpful.
