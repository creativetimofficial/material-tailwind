## Setting Up Google Analytics
</DocsTitle>

1: **Get Your Google Analytics ID**:

<ul className="ml-8 list-disc">
  <li>
    If you don't have a Google Analytics account, you can create one for free at [analytics.google.com](https://analytics.google.com).
  </li>
  <li>
    After setting up your account and creating a property for your website, you'll be provided with a Google Analytics ID (typically in the format <Code>UA-XXXXXXXXX-X</Code>).
  </li>
</ul>

<br />


2: **Add Your Google Analytics ID**:

<ul className="ml-8 list-disc">
  <li>
    Open the <Code>.env</Code> file in the root directory of your project.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add your Google Analytics ID by setting the <Code>NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID</Code> environment variable:
  </li>
</ul>

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID=<your-google-analytics-id>

  </li>
</ul>
