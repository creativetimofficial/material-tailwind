## Metadata
</DocsTitle>

We've used the Next.js default metadata feature to add metadata to the pages. You can find the base metadata structure in the <Code>app/layout.tsx</Code> file, you can modify it according to your needs.

We already setup all the important metadata for you, you just need to change the titles and descriptions based on your product.

For more information about the metadata, you can visit the [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata).

## Sitemap
</DocsTitle>

The sitemap is pre-configured in the <Code>app/sitemap.ts</Code> file. You can modify the sitemap according to your needs and add more pages by adding them to the <Code>routes</Code> array and the sitemap will automatically update.

To check the sitemap, you can visit the <Code>/sitemap.xml</Code> route.
