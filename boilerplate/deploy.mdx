Before deploying the Speedy Boilerplate to production, you need to prepare Supabase in order to work in production.

For Supabase we only need to change the site url on the Supabase dashboard, you can do this by going to the <Code>Authentication</Code> -> <Code>URL Configuration</Code> and change the site url from <Code>{`http://localhost:3000`}</Code> to your domain.

Once you update the site url on the Supabase dashboard, you also need to update the <Code>NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL</Code> from <Code>{`http://localhost:3000`}</Code> to your domain in the <Code>.env</Code> file.
