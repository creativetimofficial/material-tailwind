# Tailwind CSS Tabs - React

Get started on your web project with our responsive React and Tailwind CSS `Tabs` that create a secondary navigational hierarchy for your website.

Tabs are components that render and display subsections to users. They arrange the content into categories for easy access and a cleaner-looking app.

See below our examples that will help you create a simple and easy-to-use `Tabs` for your Tailwind CSS and React project.

## Tabs Demo

Here's how to implement a simple and responsive `Tabs` component. It can be used for showing different content in a single section of your website.

<ComponentPreview demo={<Tabs.TabsDemo />}>
```tsx
import { Tabs } from "@material-tailwind/react";

export function TabsDemo() {
  return (
    <Tabs defaultValue="html">
      <Tabs.List className="w-full">
        <Tabs.Trigger className="w-full" value="html">
          HTML
        </Tabs.Trigger>
        <Tabs.Trigger className="w-full" value="react">
          React
        </Tabs.Trigger>
        <Tabs.Trigger className="w-full" value="vue">
          Vue
        </Tabs.Trigger>
        <Tabs.Trigger className="w-full" value="angular">
          Angular
        </Tabs.Trigger>
        <Tabs.Trigger className="w-full" value="svelte">
          Svelte
        </Tabs.Trigger>
        <Tabs.TriggerIndicator />
      </Tabs.List>
      <Tabs.Panel value="html">
        It really matters and then like it really doesn't matter. What matters
        is the people who are sparked by it. And the people who are like
        offended by it, it doesn't matter.
      </Tabs.Panel>
      <Tabs.Panel value="react">
        Because it's about motivating the doers. Because I'm here to follow my
        dreams and inspire other people to follow their dreams, too.
      </Tabs.Panel>
      <Tabs.Panel value="vue">
        We're not always in the position that we want to be at. We're constantly
        growing. We're constantly making mistakes. We're constantly trying to
        express ourselves and actualize our dreams.
      </Tabs.Panel>
      <Tabs.Panel value="angular">
        Because it's about motivating the doers. Because I'm here to follow my
        dreams and inspire other people to follow their dreams, too.
      </Tabs.Panel>
      <Tabs.Panel value="svelte">
        We're not always in the position that we want to be at. We're constantly
        growing. We're constantly making mistakes. We're constantly trying to
        express ourselves and actualize our dreams.
      </Tabs.Panel>
    </Tabs>
  );
}
```
</ComponentPreview>

## Tabs with Icon

Use this example to add icons to your `Tabs.Trigger` component to make them more visually appealing and informative.

In the example below we've used the [Iconoir](https://iconoir.com/) icons, but you can use any other icon library you prefer.

<ComponentPreview demo={<Tabs.TabsWithIcon />}>
```tsx
import { Tabs } from "@material-tailwind/react";
import { SelectFace3d, ProfileCircle, Settings } from "iconoir-react";

export function TabsWithIcon() {
  return (
    <Tabs defaultValue="dashboard">
      <Tabs.List className="w-full">
        <Tabs.Trigger className="w-full" value="dashboard">
          <SelectFace3d className="me-2 h-4 w-4" />
          Dashboard
        </Tabs.Trigger>
        <Tabs.Trigger className="w-full" value="profile">
          <ProfileCircle className="me-2 h-4 w-4" />
          User Profile
        </Tabs.Trigger>
        <Tabs.Trigger className="w-full" value="settings">
          <Settings className="me-2 h-4 w-4" />
          Settings
        </Tabs.Trigger>
        <Tabs.TriggerIndicator />
      </Tabs.List>
      <Tabs.Panel value="dashboard">
        It really matters and then like it really doesn't matter. What matters
        is the people who are sparked by it. And the people who are like
        offended by it, it doesn't matter.
      </Tabs.Panel>
      <Tabs.Panel value="profile">
        Because it's about motivating the doers. Because I'm here to follow my
        dreams and inspire other people to follow their dreams, too.
      </Tabs.Panel>
      <Tabs.Panel value="settings">
        We're not always in the position that we want to be at. We're constantly
        growing. We're constantly making mistakes. We're constantly trying to
        express ourselves and actualize our dreams.
      </Tabs.Panel>
    </Tabs>
  );
}
```
</ComponentPreview>

## Vertical Tabs

You can use the `orientation` prop to change the `Tabs` component to a vertical layout. This is useful when you have the tabs on the side of the content.

<ComponentPreview demo={<Tabs.VerticalTabs />}>
```tsx
import { Tabs } from "@material-tailwind/react";

export function VerticalTabs() {
  return (
    <Tabs defaultValue="html" orientation="vertical">
      <Tabs.List>
        <Tabs.Trigger value="html">HTML</Tabs.Trigger>
        <Tabs.Trigger value="react">React</Tabs.Trigger>
        <Tabs.Trigger value="vue">Vue</Tabs.Trigger>
        <Tabs.Trigger value="angular">Angular</Tabs.Trigger>
        <Tabs.Trigger value="svelte">Svelte</Tabs.Trigger>
        <Tabs.TriggerIndicator />
      </Tabs.List>
      <Tabs.Panel value="html">
        It really matters and then like it really doesn't matter. What matters
        is the people who are sparked by it. And the people who are like
        offended by it, it doesn't matter.
      </Tabs.Panel>
      <Tabs.Panel value="react">
        Because it's about motivating the doers. Because I'm here to follow my
        dreams and inspire other people to follow their dreams, too.
      </Tabs.Panel>
      <Tabs.Panel value="vue">
        We're not always in the position that we want to be at. We're constantly
        growing. We're constantly making mistakes. We're constantly trying to
        express ourselves and actualize our dreams.
      </Tabs.Panel>
      <Tabs.Panel value="angular">
        Because it's about motivating the doers. Because I'm here to follow my
        dreams and inspire other people to follow their dreams, too.
      </Tabs.Panel>
      <Tabs.Panel value="svelte">
        We're not always in the position that we want to be at. We're constantly
        growing. We're constantly making mistakes. We're constantly trying to
        express ourselves and actualize our dreams.
      </Tabs.Panel>
    </Tabs>
  );
}
```

  );
}
