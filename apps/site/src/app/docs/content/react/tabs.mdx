# Tailwind CSS Tabs - React

Get started on your web project with our responsive React and Tailwind CSS `Tabs` that create a secondary navigational hierarchy for your website.

Tabs are components that render and display subsections to users. They arrange the content into categories for easy access and a cleaner-looking app.

See below our examples that will help you create a simple and easy-to-use `Tabs` for your Tailwind CSS and React project.

## Tabs Demo

Here's how to implement a simple and responsive `Tabs` component. It can be used for showing different content in a single section of your website.

<OldComponentPreview demo={<Tabs.TabsDemo />}>
```tsx
"use client";

import { Tabs } from "@material-tailwind/react";

export function TabsDemo() {
  return (
    <Tabs defaultValue="html">
      <Tabs.List className="w-full">
        <Tabs.Trigger className="w-full" value="html">
          HTML
        </Tabs.Trigger>
        <Tabs.Trigger className="w-full" value="react">
          React
        </Tabs.Trigger>
        <Tabs.Trigger className="w-full" value="vue">
          Vue
        </Tabs.Trigger>
        <Tabs.Trigger className="w-full" value="angular">
          Angular
        </Tabs.Trigger>
        <Tabs.Trigger className="w-full" value="svelte">
          Svelte
        </Tabs.Trigger>
        <Tabs.TriggerIndicator />
      </Tabs.List>
      <Tabs.Panel value="html">
        It really matters and then like it really doesn&apos;t matter. What
        matters is the people who are sparked by it. And the people who are like
        offended by it, it doesn&apos;t matter.
      </Tabs.Panel>
      <Tabs.Panel value="react">
        Because it&apos;s about motivating the doers. Because I&apos;m here to
        follow my dreams and inspire other people to follow their dreams, too.
      </Tabs.Panel>
      <Tabs.Panel value="vue">
        We&apos;re not always in the position that we want to be at. We&apos;re
        constantly growing. We&apos;re constantly making mistakes. We&apos;re
        constantly trying to express ourselves and actualize our dreams.
      </Tabs.Panel>
      <Tabs.Panel value="angular">
        Because it&apos;s about motivating the doers. Because I&apos;m here to
        follow my dreams and inspire other people to follow their dreams, too.
      </Tabs.Panel>
      <Tabs.Panel value="svelte">
        We&apos;re not always in the position that we want to be at. We&apos;re
        constantly growing. We&apos;re constantly making mistakes. We&apos;re
        constantly trying to express ourselves and actualize our dreams.
      </Tabs.Panel>
    </Tabs>
  );
}
```
</OldComponentPreview>

## Tabs with Icon

Use this example to add icons to your `Tabs.Trigger` component to make them more visually appealing and informative.

In the example below we've used the [Iconoir](https://iconoir.com/) icons, but you can use any other icon library you prefer.

<OldComponentPreview demo={<Tabs.TabsWithIcon />}>
```tsx
"use client";

import { Tabs } from "@material-tailwind/react";
import { SelectFace3d, ProfileCircle, Settings } from "iconoir-react";

export function TabsWithIcon() {
  return (
    <Tabs defaultValue="dashboard">
      <Tabs.List className="w-full">
        <Tabs.Trigger className="w-full" value="dashboard">
          <SelectFace3d className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
          Dashboard
        </Tabs.Trigger>
        <Tabs.Trigger className="w-full" value="profile">
          <ProfileCircle className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
          User Profile
        </Tabs.Trigger>
        <Tabs.Trigger className="w-full" value="settings">
          <Settings className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
          Settings
        </Tabs.Trigger>
        <Tabs.TriggerIndicator />
      </Tabs.List>
      <Tabs.Panel value="dashboard">
        It really matters and then like it really doesn&apos;t matter. What
        matters is the people who are sparked by it. And the people who are like
        offended by it, it doesn&apos;t matter.
      </Tabs.Panel>
      <Tabs.Panel value="profile">
        Because it&apos;s about motivating the doers. Because I&apos;m here to
        follow my dreams and inspire other people to follow their dreams, too.
      </Tabs.Panel>
      <Tabs.Panel value="settings">
        We&apos;re not always in the position that we want to be at. We&apos;re
        constantly growing. We&apos;re constantly making mistakes. We&apos;re
        constantly trying to express ourselves and actualize our dreams.
      </Tabs.Panel>
    </Tabs>
  );
}
```
</OldComponentPreview>

## Vertical Tabs

You can use the `orientation` prop to change the `Tabs` component to a vertical layout. This is useful when you have the tabs on the side of the content.

<OldComponentPreview demo={<Tabs.VerticalTabs />}>
```tsx
"use client";

import { Tabs } from "@material-tailwind/react";

export function VerticalTabs() {
  return (
    <Tabs defaultValue="html" orientation="vertical">
      <Tabs.List>
        <Tabs.Trigger value="html">HTML</Tabs.Trigger>
        <Tabs.Trigger value="react">React</Tabs.Trigger>
        <Tabs.Trigger value="vue">Vue</Tabs.Trigger>
        <Tabs.Trigger value="angular">Angular</Tabs.Trigger>
        <Tabs.Trigger value="svelte">Svelte</Tabs.Trigger>
        <Tabs.TriggerIndicator />
      </Tabs.List>
      <Tabs.Panel value="html">
        It really matters and then like it really doesn&apos;t matter. What
        matters is the people who are sparked by it. And the people who are like
        offended by it, it doesn&apos;t matter.
      </Tabs.Panel>
      <Tabs.Panel value="react">
        Because it&apos;s about motivating the doers. Because I&apos;m here to
        follow my dreams and inspire other people to follow their dreams, too.
      </Tabs.Panel>
      <Tabs.Panel value="vue">
        We&apos;re not always in the position that we want to be at. We&apos;re
        constantly growing. We&apos;re constantly making mistakes. We&apos;re
        constantly trying to express ourselves and actualize our dreams.
      </Tabs.Panel>
      <Tabs.Panel value="angular">
        Because it&apos;s about motivating the doers. Because I&apos;m here to
        follow my dreams and inspire other people to follow their dreams, too.
      </Tabs.Panel>
      <Tabs.Panel value="svelte">
        We&apos;re not always in the position that we want to be at. We&apos;re
        constantly growing. We&apos;re constantly making mistakes. We&apos;re
        constantly trying to express ourselves and actualize our dreams.
      </Tabs.Panel>
    </Tabs>
  );
}
