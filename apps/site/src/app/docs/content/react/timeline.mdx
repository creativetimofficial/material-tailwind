# Tailwind CSS Timeline - React

Use our React and Tailwind CSS `Timeline` component in your web projects. The `Timeline` can be used for displaying a list of events in order.

See below our beautiful `Timeline` component examples that you can use in your Tailwind CSS and React project. The example also comes in different styles and colors so you can adapt it easily to your needs.

          <Timeline.Separator />
          <Timeline.Icon className="h-3 w-3" />
        </Timeline.Header>
        <Timeline.Body className="-translate-y-1.5">
          <Typography color="default" className="font-bold">
            Timeline Title Here.
          </Typography>
          <Typography type="small" className="mt-2 text-foreground">

            way, it took me twenty five years to get these plants, twenty five
            years of blood sweat and tears, and I&apos;m never giving up,

## Timeline with Icon

You can also add an icon to the `Timeline` component. This can be done by using the `Timeline.Icon` component. In the example below we've used the [Iconoir](https://iconoir.com/) icons, but you can use any other icon library you prefer.

<OldComponentPreview demo={<Timeline.TimelineWithIcon />}>
```tsx
"use client";

import { Timeline, Typography } from "@material-tailwind/react";
import { Bell, DollarCircle, HomeSimple } from "iconoir-react";

export function TimelineWithIcon() {
  return (
    <Timeline color="secondary" orientation="vertical">
      <Timeline.Item>
        <Timeline.Header>
          <Timeline.Separator />
          <Timeline.Icon>
            <HomeSimple className="h-5 w-5" />
          </Timeline.Icon>
        </Timeline.Header>
        <Timeline.Body className="-translate-y-1.5">
          <Typography color="default" className="font-bold">
            Timeline Title Here.
          </Typography>
          <Typography type="small" className="mt-2 text-foreground">
            The key to more success is to have a lot of pillows. Put it this
            way, it took me twenty five years to get these plants, twenty five

          </Timeline.Icon>
        </Timeline.Header>
        <Timeline.Body className="-translate-y-1.5">
