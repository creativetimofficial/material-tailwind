# Tailwind CSS Rating - React

Use our Tailwind CSS `Rating` component to show reviews and ratings in your web projects. The `Rating` can be used as a visual identifier for reviews and rating on your website.

See below our beautiful `Rating` examples that you can use in your Tailwind CSS and React project. The example also comes in different styles and colors so you can adapt it easily to your needs.

## Rating Demo

Here's how to implement a simple `Rating` component. It can be used for providing rating to the product or app in your website.

import { Rating } from "@material-tailwind/react";

export function RatingDemo() {
  return <Rating value={4} />;
}
```
</ComponentPreview>

## Rating Colors

We provide different colors for `Rating` component like `primary`, `secondary`, `info`, `success`, `warning`, and `error` so you can adapt it easily to your needs. You can simply use the `color` prop to change the `Rating` component color.

In the example below, we've showcased the different colors for `Rating` color that you can use in your project.

<ComponentPreview demo={<Rating.RatingColors />}>
```tsx
"use client";

import { Rating } from "@material-tailwind/react";

export function RatingColors() {
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
      <Rating value={4} color="primary" />
      <Rating value={4} color="secondary" />
      <Rating value={4} color="info" />
      <Rating value={4} color="success" />
      <Rating value={4} color="warning" />
      <Rating value={4} color="error" />
    </div>
  );
}
```
</ComponentPreview>

## Readonly Rating

You can use the `readonly` prop to make the `Rating` component readonly, it's useful for just showing rating and prevent the user from interacting with the `Rating` component.

<ComponentPreview demo={<Rating.ReadonlyRating />}>
```tsx
"use client";

import { Rating } from "@material-tailwind/react";

export function ReadonlyRating() {
  return <Rating value={4} readonly />;
}
```
</ComponentPreview>

## Custom Rating Icon

You can use the `ratedIcon` and `unratedIcon` props for customizing the icons for rated and unrated states of `Rating` component. In the example below, we've showcased custom icons used for `Rating` component that you can use in your project.

<ComponentPreview demo={<Rating.CustomRatingIcon />}>
```tsx
"use client";

import { Rating } from "@material-tailwind/react";
import { Heart, HeartSolid } from "iconoir-react";

export function CustomRatingIcon() {
  return <Rating value={4} unratedIcon={Heart} ratedIcon={HeartSolid} />;
}
```
</ComponentPreview>

## Rating with Text

The `Rating` component can be used with a label to provide more context to the user. In the example below, we've added a label by using the `Rating` and `Typography` components together.

<ComponentPreview demo={<Rating.RatingWithText />}>
```tsx
"use client";

import * as React from "react";
import { Rating, Typography } from "@material-tailwind/react";

export function RatingWithText() {
  const [rated, setRated] = React.useState(4);

  return (
    <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
      <Typography color="primary" className="font-semibold">
        {rated}
      </Typography>
      <Rating value={4} onValueChange={(value) => setRated(value)} />
      <Typography color="default" className="font-semibold">
        Based on 134 Reviews
      </Typography>
    </div>
  );
}
```
</ComponentPreview>
