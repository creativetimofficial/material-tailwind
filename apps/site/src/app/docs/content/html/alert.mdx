# Tailwind CSS Alerts

Get started on your web projects with our Tailwind CSS alert which provides contextual feedback messages for typical user actions.

An alert displays a short and important message attracting the user's attention without interrupting the user's task. Use this element when you need to show highly-important messages to users or when you need a persistent static container that is closable by user actions.

Below we are presenting examples of alerts that you can use in your Tailwind CSS project. The examples come in different colors and styles so you can adapt them easily to your needs.
