# Tailwind CSS Video

Use our Tailwind CSS video examples to add video player to your web project. This component displays media content (video) on your website.

Our component encapsulates all the functionalities needed to play videos, including but not limited to playback controls (like play/pause, volume control, fullscreen toggle), loading of video sources, display of video metadata (such as duration and current time).

Check out below our component examples.

## Video Demo

Add videos to your website using our component that comes with rounded corners and playback controls.

<OldComponentPreview demo={<HTMLVideo.VideoDemo />}>
```html
<video class="w-full h-full rounded-lg" controls>
  <source src="https://dub.sh/H1glk5b" type="video/mp4" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```
</OldComponentPreview>

## Video Autoplay

This example includes the autoPlay attribute on the `<video>` tag making the video start playing automatically as soon as it is loaded, without requiring the user to initiate playback manually.

<OldComponentPreview demo={<HTMLVideo.VideoAutoplay />}>
```html
<video class="w-full h-full rounded-lg" controls autoPlay>
  <source src="https://dub.sh/H1glk5b" type="video/mp4" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```
</OldComponentPreview>

## Video Muted

By adding `muted` to the `<video>` tag, the video will play without sound by default when the page loads. This attribute is particularly important in conjunction with autoPlay, as many modern web browsers restrict autoplay functionality for videos with sound to prevent disrupting the user experience.

<OldComponentPreview demo={<HTMLVideo.VideoMuted />}>
```html
<video class="w-full h-full rounded-lg" controls muted>
  <source src="https://dub.sh/H1glk5b" type="video/mp4" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```
</OldComponentPreview>

<br />
Videos that autoplay with sound can be intrusive, so this restriction aims to improve the overall browsing experience.

However, videos that are muted are typically allowed to autoplay, making this combination useful for background videos, promotional content, or any scenario where immediate engagement is desired without audio disruption.
