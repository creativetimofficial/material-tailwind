## Badge Custom Styles

Use this example in your project if you want to represent a completed or acknowledged state.

The badge indicator is styled as a small, circular badge (`rounded-full`) with a background (`bg-black`), a white border (`border border-white`), and a shadow (`shadow-lg shadow-black/25`). It also contains an SVG icon, which is a checkmark (`<svg>` element), indicating a positive or completed status.
