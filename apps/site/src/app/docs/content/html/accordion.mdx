## Accordion All Open

You can set all the `Accordion` items to be open by default by passing an array of values to the `defaultValue` prop.

<OldComponentPreview demo={<HTMLAccordion.AccordionAllOpen />}>
```html
<div></div>
```
</OldComponentPreview>

---

## Controlled Accordion

The `Accordion` component could be either controlled or uncontrolled. In the controlled mode, you can manage the state of the `Accordion` component by yourself. You can use the `value` and `onValueChange` props to control the state of the `Accordion` component.

<OldComponentPreview demo={<Accordion.ControlledAccordion />}>
```tsx
import * as React from "react";
import { Accordion, Button } from "@material-tailwind/react";
import { NavArrowDown } from "iconoir-react";

export function ControlledAccordion() {
  const [open, setOpen] = React.useState("html");

  return (
    <div>
      <div className="mb-4 flex gap-2">
        <Button
          isFullWidth
          variant={open === "react" ? "solid" : "outline"}
          onClick={() => setOpen("react")}
        >
          React Version
        </Button>
        <Button
          isFullWidth
          variant={open === "html" ? "solid" : "outline"}
          onClick={() => setOpen("html")}
        >
          HTML Version
        </Button>
        <Button
          isFullWidth
          variant={open === "vue" ? "solid" : "outline"}
          onClick={() => setOpen("vue")}

}
```

## Accordion Custom Icon

You can customize the `Accordion` trigger icon by using the `Accordion.Trigger` component. To make it work, you need to use `group-data-[open=true]` for the icons to show/hide based on the `Accordion` state.


<OldComponentPreview demo={<Accordion.AccordionCustomIcon />}>
```tsx
import { Accordion } from "@material-tailwind/react";
import { Minus, Plus } from "iconoir-react";

export function AccordionCustomIcon() {
  return (
    <Accordion defaultValue="react">
      <Accordion.Item value="react">
        <Accordion.Trigger>
          Material Tailwind React
          <Plus className="block h-4 w-4 group-data-[open=true]:hidden" />
          <Minus className="hidden h-4 w-4 group-data-[open=true]:block" />

## Accordion Custom Styles

You can customize the `Accordion` component by using the `className` prop. In the example below, we've showcased how to create a custom style for the `Accordion` component.
