# Tailwind CSS Accordion

Use our Tailwind CSS accordion component to allow the user to show and hide sections of related content on a page. There are many ways to use this component, like displaying a list of FAQs, showing various menus and submenus, displaying the locations of a particular company, and so on.

See below our simple and versatile accordion example that you can use in your Tailwind CSS projects. We also included some accordion props that are available.

To use an accordion example that has items expanded, add the **.open** class on the **.collapse** `<div>`.

          We’re not always in the position that we want to be at. We’re
          constantly growing. We’re constantly making mistakes. We’re
          constantly trying to express ourselves and actualize our
          dreams. If you have the opportunity to play this game of life
          you need to appreciate every moment. A lot of people don’t
          appreciate the moment until it’s passed.

          It really matters and then like it really doesn’t matter. What
          matters is the people who are sparked by it. And the people
          who are like offended by it, it doesn’t matter. Because it's
          about motivating the doers. Because I’m here to follow my
          dreams and inspire other people to follow their dreams, too.

          The time is now for it to be okay to be great. People in this world shun people for being great. For being a bright color. For standing out. But the time is now to be okay to be the greatest you. Would you believe in what you
          believe in, if you were the only one who believed it?
          If everything I did failed - which it doesn't, it actually succeeds - just the fact that I'm willing to fail is an inspiration. People are so scared to lose that they don't even try. Like, one thing people can't say is that I'm not
          trying, and I'm not trying my hardest, and I'm not trying to do the best way I know how.
