# Tailwind CSS Accordion - React

Use our Tailwind CSS <Code>Accordion</Code> component to allow the user to show and hide sections of related content on a page. There are many ways to use this component, like displaying a list of FAQs, showing various menus and submenus, displaying the locations of a particular company, and so on.

See below our simple and versatile <Code>Accordion</Code> example that you can use in your React and Tailwind CSS projects. We also included some <Code>Accordion</Code> props that are available.
