<br />

```

---

## Using Yarn

```

---

<span id="pnpm" className="scroll-mt-48" />

```bash

```

## TailwindCSS Configurations

<span id="tailwindcss-config" className="scroll-mt-48" />

Once you install @material-tailwind/react you need to wrap your tailwind css configurations with the <Code>withMT()</Code> function coming from @material-tailwind/react/utils.

```js {1, 3, 9}
const withMT = require("@material-tailwind/react/utils/withMT");

module.exports = withMT({
  content: ["./app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
});
```

---

## Theme Provider

<span id="theme-provider" className="scroll-mt-48" />

@material-tailwind/react comes with a theme provider that set's the default theme/styles for components or to provide your own theme/styles to your components. You need to wrap your entire application with the <Code>ThemeProvider</Code> coming from @material-tailwind/react.

On the <Code>app/entry.client.jsx</Code> or <Code>app/entry.client.tsx</Code> if you're using typescript put the code bellow.

```jsx {3, 6, 8}
import { RemixBrowser } from "@remix-run/react";
import { hydrate } from "react-dom";
import { ThemeProvider } from "@material-tailwind/react";

hydrate(
  <ThemeProvider>
    <RemixBrowser />
  </ThemeProvider>,
  document
);
```

---

## Example

Now you're good to go and use @material-tailwind/react in your project.

<ComponentDemo id="example">
  <Button>Button</Button>
</ComponentDemo>

```jsx showLineNumbers {1, 4}
import { Button } from "@material-tailwind/react";

export default function Example() {
  return <Button>Button</Button>;
}
```
