# Material Tailwind with Vite

<span id="installation" className="scroll-mt-48" />
Learn how to setup and install @material-tailwind/react with Vite (React).

> `@material-tailwind/react` is working with Tailwind CSS classes and you need to have Tailwind CSS installed on your project - [Tailwind CSS Installation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite).

<br />
<br />

## Using NPM

Install @material-tailwind/react as a dependency using NPM by running the following command:

<span id="npm" className="scroll-mt-48" />

```bash
npm i @material-tailwind/react
```

---

## Using Yarn

Install @material-tailwind/react as a dependency using Yarn by running the following command:

<span id="yarn" className="scroll-mt-48" />

```bash
yarn add @material-tailwind/react
```

---

## Using PNPM

Install @material-tailwind/react as a dependency using PNPM by running the following command:

<span id="pnpm" className="scroll-mt-48" />

```bash
pnpm i @material-tailwind/react
```

## TailwindCSS Configurations

<span id="tailwindcss-config" className="scroll-mt-48" />

Once you install @material-tailwind/react you need to wrap your tailwind css configurations with the <Code>withMT()</Code> function coming from @material-tailwind/react/utils.

```js {1, 3, 9}
const withMT = require("@material-tailwind/react/utils/withMT");

module.exports = withMT({
  content: ["./index.html", "./src/**/*.{vue,js,ts,jsx,tsx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
});
```

---

## Theme Provider

<span id="theme-provider" className="scroll-mt-48" />

@material-tailwind/react comes with a theme provider that set's the default theme/styles for components or to provide your own theme/styles to your components. You need to wrap your entire application with the <Code>ThemeProvider</Code> coming from @material-tailwind/react.

On the <Code>src/main</Code> put the code bellow.

```jsx {6, 10, 12}
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App";
import "./index.css";

import { ThemeProvider } from "@material-tailwind/react";

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <ThemeProvider>
      <App />
    </ThemeProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

## Example

Now you're good to go and use @material-tailwind/react in your project.

<ComponentDemo id="example">
  <Button>Button</Button>
</ComponentDemo>

```jsx {1, 4}
import { Button } from "@material-tailwind/react";

export default function Example() {
  return <Button>Button</Button>;
}
```
